# #  Interactive Image Processing Application
      This interactive image processing application allows users to explore various
      image processing techniques in real-time using their webcam. It provides a graphical
      user interface (GUI) for adjusting parameters and visualizing the effects of different
      image processing algorithms.

## Features
      Live Webcam Stream: View live video feed from your webcam
      directly within the application.
      Real-time Processing: Apply image processing algorithms to the live
      video stream and see the results instantly.
      Multiple Processing Options: Choose from a variety of image processing
      techniques, including grayscale conversion, channel splitting, segmentation,
      color space conversion (RGB to HSV and YCbCr), high-contrast
      grayscale filtering, blur filtering, and more.
      Interactive Controls: Use sliders to adjust parameters and thresholds
      for segmentation and filtering algorithms.
      Face Detection: Detect and highlight faces in the
      video stream using ML5.js Face API.
      Fun Filters: Apply fun filters like pixelation and decorations to detected faces
      for an entertaining experience.

##Image Processing Techniques
      Grayscale Conversion
      Converts the color image to grayscale using optimized luma calculation.

## Channel Splitting
      Splits the image into its RGB channels, allowing users to visualize the individual color channels separately.

## Segmentation
      Segment the image based on user-defined thresholds for each color channel,
      enabling selective highlighting or suppression of features.

## Color Space Conversion (RGB to HSV and YCbCr)
      Converts the RGB color space to HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) and YCbCr color space,
      offering insights into color distribution and intensity.

## High-Contrast Grayscale Filtering
      Applies a high-contrast filter to the grayscale image,
      enhancing the contrast between dark and light regions.

## Blur Filtering
      Applies a blur filter to the image using convolution,
      smoothing out details and reducing noise.

## Fun Filters
      Applies entertaining filters like pixelation and decorations to
      detected faces for a fun and engaging experience.
